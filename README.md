## Rules

Take your chances rolling the dice to see who can get to 100 points first, but becareful....

  - Rolling a 1 will cause you to lose all your points and force the end of your turn
  - If you're not feeling very lucky, that's okay!  You can save your points using the HOLD, which will automatically add the points to your total score and end your turn
  - First person to hold and reach 100 points or more will win the game!

Do you feel lucky?
